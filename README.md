The absense of variable "cloth_category" results in "u2net_cloth_seg" outputting segmented clothes in one concatenated image, as mentioned in Issue #1.

I do not know how any of this works, so I have written basic code that implements a dropdown box("upper","lower,"full") that assigns a value to "cloth_category".
